# The Violet Sector (iOS)

An iOS client for [The Violet Sector](https://www.violetsector.com/) web game using the [documented JSON API](https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis-docs/ecvej/TVS-JSON/0.1).

## Testing

If you choose to compile and run the source code yourself you will have to change the project's bundle identifier beforehand, as I've explicitly registered pt.xce.The-Violet-Sector to my account in order to avoid accidental collisions with people testing this on free developer accounts.  It is also possible to test using ad-hoc distribution, but in order to test using this option I will have to generate a signed IPA and you will need to send me the identifier of the device on which you wish to test the project.

## Compatibility

At the moment this project requires iOS 14.0 or later, but I might change the requirement to a later version to take advantage of the newest enhancements to SwiftUI.
